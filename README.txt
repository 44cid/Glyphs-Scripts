This are some sample scripts and the neseccary files to use robofab scripts from within Glyphs.

Copy the files to ~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts/

You may organize files with subfolders.

Only two files ("Glyphs Export.py", "Glyphs Import.py") need to go the FontLab Macro Folder: ~/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/ (copy the path, in Finder hit cup+shift+G and paste the path.)
