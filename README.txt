These are some sample scripts and the necessary files to use Robofab scripts from within Glyphs.
Copy the files to the Glyphs Scripts folder. To navigate there quickly, choose Open Scripts Folder from the Scripts menu.
Feel free to organize files in subfolders.

Only two files ("Glyphs Export.py", "Glyphs Import.py") need to go to the FontLab Macros Folder:
~/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/
Copy the path, and in Finder, press cmd+shift+G and paste the path.
